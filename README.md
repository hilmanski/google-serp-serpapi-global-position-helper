# About
Helper for getting block position from SerpApi SERP result.

## How to run
- Run `npm install` once
- Create `.env` file and add your SERPAPI_API_KEY
- Adjust the searchID on `index.js` file to ID you want to check
- Run with `node index`

## Notes
Currently, we always put knowledge_graph at the last position. 

# Status
Can't continue since currently the xray class position is not very reliable on mobile.
